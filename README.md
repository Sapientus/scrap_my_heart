# DAY 2 after the Farewell

"Why doesn't he love me?" - this is one of the thoughts I wake up with.

I think it's obvious that I have nightmares every night, I've been having them for quite a long time.

I wouldn't say that this is the main reason of my sadness but his leaving me in the moment I needed him the most is just heartbreaking.
Nevertheless, I feel only warm and beautiful feelings towards him because it was my choice and I respect it.

Not counting my huge missing him, I'm also extremely disappointed by our government and medicine. I feel like I'm burned out.

I know I can't change this unfair world but I'll do my best to change it at least around me and give hope to others for the better future.

To do this, I need to change myself at first. I write this hoping that once I will read it all again and laugh because I'll be completely different then, better than I am.

# What have I done?

1. Waking up (yeah, such an easy thing is an actual achievement for me).
2. Cleaning my mind from my dark thoughts. I actually almost gave up here.
3. Working. It takes the biggest part of my day. I met a beautiful patient, it appeared she also loves dogs and helps them.
4. Trying to study Python while having some free time at work.
5. Writing lyrics for my future rock-cover. It will be "Chasing rainbows" by Bring me the horizon.
6. I rememberred that I didn't eat anything so I had to cook.
7. Crying (What? Let me be weak at least when nobody sees it)
8. Coding ... my eyes are closing now, I will finish it here.
